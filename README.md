# Game-Engine
Free time project for making a game engine on winOS

At the moment, construction XInput support has been completed, next will be minor code clean ups and move on to Rendering system.

###### XInput X360 gamepad controller support has been finished and commented out for implementation purposes, next under construction is the Rendering system, which will be done completely from scratch, and am at the moment learning in depth how bits of the RGBx schema function. Currently, an executable does work as intended, and is available here. win32_engine.cpp is a constant work in progress, and is the first file in the entirety of the engine.

###### Download the .exe and plug in a Xbox controller (preferably 360 as was tested for) and push the AButton.
