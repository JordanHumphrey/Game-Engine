# Game-Engine
Free time project for making a game engine on winOS

At the moment, construction of window has been finished for the most part, left TODO's for things that need to be cleaned up or re-evaluated.

###### Next under construction is the Rendering system, which will be done completely from scratch, and am at the moment learning in depth how bits of the RGBx schema function. Currently, an executable does work as intended, and is available here. Once the source file win32_engine.cpp is cleaned up, I will post to this repository. ETA: this week.
